# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. The first step is exploring the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next step is to properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. After that is to analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. And finally, the optimal model will be tested on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to the statistics.
