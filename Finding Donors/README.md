# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. The first step of this project is to explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. The second step is to apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. Then several supervised learners will be evaluated on the data and I will choose the best suited for the solution. Afterwards, I will optimize the model I've selected and present it as my solution to CharityML. Finally, I will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
